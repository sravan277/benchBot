Absolutely! Below is a **detailed explanation of each step** across all 5 questions in your lab/internal assessment. This will help you understand **what to do, why you’re doing it, and how to execute it properly** to score full marks.

---

## ✅ **Q1. Problem Statement Analysis – 10 Marks**

### 1. Abstract – Summarize the problem in your own words
> **What it means**: You are given a problem (e.g., “Build a Student Management System”). You must write a short paragraph (50–100 words) that captures the **core purpose** of the system — what it does, who it’s for, and why it’s needed — **in your own words**.
>
> **Example**:  
> *“The system allows university administrators to manage student records including enrollment, grades, and attendance. It provides a web interface for CRUD operations, ensuring data accuracy and reducing manual paperwork. The goal is to digitize and streamline academic record-keeping.”*

✅ **Tip**: Avoid copying the problem statement. Paraphrase and focus on the *essence*.

---

### 2. Functional Requirements
> **What it means**: List **what the system must DO** — features, actions, user interactions.
>
> These are **measurable, testable behaviors**.
>
> **Examples**:
> - User can login with email and password.
> - Admin can add, edit, or delete student records.
> - System generates PDF report of student grades.
> - User receives email notification upon registration.

✅ **Tip**: Start each point with a verb (e.g., “The system shall allow...”, “User can...”).

---

### 3. Non-Functional Requirements
> **What it means**: Describe **how well** the system performs — quality attributes, not features.
>
> **Examples**:
> - The system must respond within 2 seconds for any user action.
> - Must support 1000 concurrent users.
> - Must be available 99.9% of the time.
> - Must be secure (HTTPS, encrypted passwords).
> - Must be compatible with Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

✅ **Tip**: Think: Performance, Security, Usability, Scalability, Reliability, Portability.

---

### 4. Users
> **What it means**: Identify **who will use the system** and their roles.
>
> **Examples**:
> - **Admin**: Manages users, configures system settings.
> - **Student**: Views grades, updates profile.
> - **Faculty**: Uploads grades, takes attendance.
> - **Guest**: Can view public course catalog (read-only).

✅ **Tip**: For each user, briefly describe their permissions or main activities.

---

## ✅ **Q2. Maven Project Building – 30 Marks**

### Goal: Import, build, and verify a Maven project in Eclipse.

---

### 1. Import the project into Maven environment

#### Steps:
- **Open Eclipse IDE** → Preferably “Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers” (has built-in Maven, Git, Server tools).
- Go to **File → Import → Git → Projects from Git → Next**
- Choose **Clone URI → Next**
- Paste the **GitHub repo URL** (e.g., `https://github.com/username/repository.git`)
- Select branch → Usually `main` or `master` → Next
- Choose **local directory** to clone into → Finish

✅ Eclipse will clone the repo and try to auto-import as a Maven project.

---

### 2. Resolve dependencies using pom.xml

> **What it means**: Maven uses `pom.xml` (Project Object Model) to manage libraries (JARs). When you import, Eclipse/Maven should auto-download dependencies.

#### If dependencies are not resolved:
- Right-click project → **Maven → Update Project** → Check “Force Update” → OK
- Ensure you’re connected to the internet.
- Check for red errors in `pom.xml` — fix version conflicts or missing artifacts.

✅ **Tip**: Look in “Maven Dependencies” in Project Explorer — should list all JARs.

---

### 3. Build the project to generate WAR/JAR file

> **What it means**: Compile code and package into deployable format.

#### Steps:
- Right-click project → **Run As → Maven Build...**
- In “Goals” field, type: `clean package`
- Click **Run**

✅ This runs Maven lifecycle: cleans old files → compiles → packages → generates WAR/JAR in `target/` folder.

---

### 4. Verify the generated artifact in target/ folder

> Go to your project in Eclipse → expand `target/` folder → you should see:
> - `your-project-name.war` (for web apps)
> - or `your-project-name.jar` (for standalone apps)

✅ **Tip**: Double-check file size — if it’s 1KB, build failed. Look at Console for errors.

---

## ✅ **Q3. Git and GitHub – 30 Marks**

### Goal: Use Git to track code, solve tasks, and push to GitHub.

---

### 1. Initialize Git repository and add project files

> If not auto-initialized during clone:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

✅ This starts version control for your project.

---

### 2. Set global config

> Configure your identity (if not already set):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```

✅ Required so your commits are attributed to you.

---

### 3. Solve SQB Git tasks (branch, merge, revert, etc.)

> Example tasks you might get:

#### a. Create a new branch:
```bash
git branch feature-login
git checkout feature-login
# or
git checkout -b feature-login
```

#### b. Make a change, commit:
```bash
# edit a file
git add .
git commit -m "Added login validation"
```

#### c. Switch back to main & merge:
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-login
```

#### d. Revert a commit:
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```

✅ Practice these — they are common SQB (Short Question Based) tasks.

---

### 4. Push your Maven project to GitHub

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
git push -u origin main
```

✅ Make sure you’ve committed all changes before pushing.

---

## ✅ **Q4. Docker – 20 Marks**

### Goal: Containerize your Maven app using Docker.

---

### 1. Dockerfile Creation

> Create a file named `Dockerfile` (no extension) in your project root.

#### Sample for WAR on Tomcat:

```dockerfile
FROM tomcat:9.0-jre11
COPY target/your-app.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
```

#### Sample for JAR (Spring Boot):

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim
COPY target/your-app.jar /app.jar
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
```

✅ Refer to the given GitHub link for exact structure:  
→ https://github.com/archanareddyse/labinternal-1.git

---

### 2. Image Building

> In terminal (inside project folder):

```bash
docker build -t myapp:1.0 .
```

✅ `.` means “build from current directory”.  
✅ Use `docker images` to verify image is created.

---

### 3. Push to Docker Hub

> First, login:

```bash
docker login
```

> Tag your image with your Docker Hub username:

```bash
docker tag myapp:1.0 yourdockerid/myapp:1.0
```

> Push:

```bash
docker push yourdockerid/myapp:1.0
```

✅ Verify on https://hub.docker.com

---

### 4. SQB – Docker Short Questions

> Be ready to answer things like:

- **What is the difference between image and container?**  
  → *Image = blueprint/template. Container = running instance of an image.*

- **What does `docker run` do?**  
  → *Creates and starts a container from an image.*

- **How to see running containers?**  
  → `docker ps`

- **How to stop a container?**  
  → `docker stop <container-id>`

✅ Revise basic Docker commands and concepts.

---

## ✅ **Q5. Docker Compose – 10 Marks**

### Goal: Run your app + database together using `docker-compose.yml`

---

### 1. Container 1 – Your app image from Docker Hub

### 2. Container 2 – Database (e.g., MySQL)

---

#### Sample `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    image: yourdockerid/myapp:1.0
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      - DB_HOST=db
      - DB_USER=root
      - DB_PASS=secret

  db:
    image: mysql:8.0
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret
      MYSQL_DATABASE: myappdb
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    volumes:
      - mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  mysql_data:
```

✅ Replace `yourdockerid/myapp:1.0` with your actual image.  
✅ Adjust environment variables based on your app’s DB config.

---

### 3. Demonstrate service startup

> In terminal, run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

✅ You should see both containers starting.  
✅ Access your app at `http://localhost:8080`  
✅ Use `docker-compose down` to stop.

|------|-----|
| **Clarity** | Write neatly, label sections, comment code/Dockerfile |
| **Correctness** | Double-check commands, filenames, ports, image names |
| **Execution** | Actually run every command — don’t fake it |
| **Verification** | Always verify: Is the WAR built? Is the image pushed? Is compose running? |
| **SQB Answers** | Be concise, accurate, use correct terminology |
