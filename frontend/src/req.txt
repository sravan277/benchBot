Q5. Docker Compose -- 10 Marks
Task: Write a docker-compose.yml file for a multi-container setup.
1.	Container 1 – Use the Docker image you pushed to Docker Hub 
2.	Container 2 – Configure a database container (MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDBEnsure both containers are running together 
3.	Demonstrate service startup with docker-compose up 
________________________________________
Note to Students:
•	All steps must be executed practically.
•	Marks will be awarded for correctness, clarity, and proper usage of tools.
________________________________________

Step 1: Requirements

Container 1 – Run the Maven project (the Docker image pushed to Docker Hub in Q4).

Container 2 – Run a database (MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB).

Both should run together and communicate.

Demonstrate startup using:

docker-compose up

Step 2: Example docker-compose.yml

Here’s an example using Tomcat + MySQL:

version: "3.9"

services:
  webapp:
    image: username/my-maven-app:v1   # replace with your Docker Hub image
    container_name: webapp-container
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      - DB_HOST=db
      - DB_USER=root
      - DB_PASSWORD=root

  db:
    image: mysql:8.0
    container_name: mysql-container
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
      MYSQL_DATABASE: mydb
      MYSQL_USER: appuser
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: apppass
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  db_data:

Step 3: Running the setup

Save the above file as docker-compose.yml.

Run:

docker-compose up --build


Both containers (app + DB) will start.

Access app in browser: http://localhost:8080

Step 4: Common Errors/Difficulties

App can’t connect to DB

Fix: Use service name (db) as hostname instead of localhost.

Example: JDBC URL → jdbc:mysql://db:3306/mydb.

Port already in use

If 8080 or 3306 is busy, use different host ports:

ports:
  - "8081:8080"
  - "3307:3306"


Database not ready before app starts

App may crash if DB takes time to initialize.

Fix: Add retries or wait-for-db script.

Forgot Docker Hub login

If image is private, must docker login.

YAML indentation errors

Always use spaces, not tabs.

Step 5: Short Questions (SQB)

Possible quick questions in this section:

Difference between docker run and docker-compose up.

What is the role of depends_on in Docker Compose?

How do volumes help in Docker Compose?

Command to stop containers started by Docker Compose?

docker-compose down


✅ With this, Q5 is fully explained with example, execution steps, errors, and SQBs.
